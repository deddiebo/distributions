# Random Distributions

### *This is a repository of some of my learning and experimental coding of random distributions.*
### *All these programs can be run with various parameters to visualize the results.*
### They are in Jupyter Notebooks using Python and Matplotlab (plus some numpy and scipy)


## some distributions:

- ### binomial
**parameters(p,k)  &emsp;  (probability, number of samples)**
1. Plots of examples
2. Histogram plot of n iterations of an example
3. Probability Mass Function plot of an example
4. Cumulative Distribution Function plot of an example
5. Percent Point Function plot of an example


- ### normal
**parameters(mu,sigma)  &emsp;  (mean, standard deviation)**
sometimes variance (sigma squared) is used as a parameter
1. Probability Density Function plot with standard deviations
2. Cumulative Distribution Function plot with standard deviations
3. Percent Point Function plot with selectable quantiles
4. Using CDF to calculate the probability of being in a range
5. Using PPF to calculate value below a percentile


- ### lognormal
- ### exponential
- ### geometric
**parameter(p)  &emsp;  (probability of success of a single trial)**
1. Histogram of number of Bernoulli trials needed to get the first success
2. Cumulative Distribution Function plot of an example
3. Percent Point Function plot of an example


- ### poisson
**parameter(lambda)  &emsp;  (number of independent events with a constant average in a given time period)
1. Probability Mass Function plots of various examples of lambda values
2. Cumulative Distribution Function plots of examples
3. Percent Point Function plots of examples
4. Samples from a poisson distribution
5. Histogram of samples
