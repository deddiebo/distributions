# Random Distributions

### *This is a repository of some of my learning and experimental coding of random distributions.*
### *All these programs can be run with various parameters to visualize the results.*
### They are in Jupyter Notebooks using Python and Matplotlab (plus some numpy and scipy)


## some distributions:

- ### binomial
**parameters(p,k)  &emsp;  (probability, number of samples)**
1. Plots of examples
2. Histogram plot of n iterations of an example
3. Probability Mass Function plot of an example
4. Cumulative Distribution Function plot of an example
5. Percent Point Function plot of an example


- ### normal
**parameters(mu,sigma)  &emsp;  (mean, standard deviation)**
sometimes variance (sigma squared) is used as a parameter
1. Probability Density Function with standard deviations
2. Cumulative Distribution Function with standard deviations
3. Percent Point Function with selectable quantiles
4. Using CDF to calculate the probability of being in a range
5. Using PPF to calculate value below a percentile


- ### lognormal
- ### exponential
- ### geometric
**parameter(p)  &emsp;  (probability of success of a single trial)**
1. Histogram of number of Bernoulli trials needed to get the first success
2. Plot of Cumulative Distribution Function of an example
3. Plot of Point Percent Function of an example


- ### poisson
